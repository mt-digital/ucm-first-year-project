Below we first show the results of partitioning the figurative instances 
by phases of the election cycle. Then we'll look at the semantic networks
around the violence metaphors and in general. Finally, we'll consider 
daily timeseries of usage of metaphorical violence, and explore what causal
links there might be between them.

  7-day moving average and daily counts of the figurative uses of the three-most
  used violent words in figurative constructions. Uses come from a variety of
  conceptual metaphors which more or less reduce to 
  \textsc{politics is a physical fight}. The first three dashed 
  vertical lines are the dates of the presidential debates, 
  September 26, October 9, and October 19, 2016. The last dashed
  line is election day, November 8, 2016.
