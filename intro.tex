On September 6, 2016, Lawrence O'Donnell said on his MSNBC show that 
``Donald Trump was hit with knockout punches that
would have wiped out any previous presidential candidate.'' Such figurative
violence is commonly heard and read in news coverage of politics. However, when
we step back it seems odd: if we were watching ESPN we would imagine one boxer
down on the mat and another boxer with his or her hands raised in triumph. 
A month later, October 6, 2016, we might wonder just what did Megyn 
Kelly mean when she said ``Don't be on defense. But punch back.
Punch at her and punch relentlessly as it goes on''? Who is punching and
who is being punched? Megyn Kelly was urging Donald Trump to ``punch''
Hillary Clinton ``relentlessly'' in the second presidential debate.
These are just two of many metaphorical uses of violence surrounding the 
United States' presidential election of 2016. 

In the past few decades, much has been discovered about metaphor and its use
in structuring abstract concepts, like a debate, in terms of embodied concepts,
like a fight. Typically, this research studies metaphors as static entities,
typically from some prepared text or speech. In contrast, this paper presents
an analysis of the dynamics of metaphorical violence usage in the months
surrounding the United States presidential elections of 2016. The cultural
events of the presidential debates and the election itself are taken as 
a driver, which drives the system producing figurative violence constructions
to a state in which it produces more uses of figurative violence. In this way
we can study the ``rise time'' and ``fall time'' 
of metaphorical violence in response to these cultural events. 

\citeA{Lakoff1980} woke the world up to all the various 
\textit{Metaphors we Live By}. In that work, and in much subsequent work, 
we have increasingly recognized the importance of metaphor. Metaphor is the key
for understanding just how humans conceptualize abstract things from love to
mathematics. Evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that metaphor allows us to
understand abstract things in terms of physical experience. A \textit{conceptual
metaphor} is the general term for a mental metaphorical relationship. Often
these are written in small caps, such as \textsc{love is a journey} or 
\textsc{a debate is a physical fight}.
This distinguishes conceptual relationships from their linguistic instantiations.
An instantiation of \textsc{love is a journey} would be ``our relationship is
at a crossroads: he's moving to Omaha, but I love California, maybe more than
him.'' The examples shown in the first paragraph could both be considered
linguistic instantiations of \textsc{politics is a physical fight}. In a conceptual
metaphor, we say that the \textit{source domain} is mapped to the \textit{target
domain}. In \textsc{politics is a physical fight}, \textit{physical fight}
is the source domain. Some elements from the source domain are cognitively
assigned to the target domain, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:source-target-schematic}.
However, other elements of the source domain are not mapped on the target domain.
For instance, one could go to jail if involved in a physical fight, but not for
legally participating in politics.

Even if one has not been in a fight, most of us feel a rush of 
adrenaline when we observe a fight or even hear about a fight or other violence.
Most metaphor research, however, is implicitly static: changes over time in
usage are not as well studied. Furthermore, while there is some work that has
been done on the effect of culture on metaphor, there is little done to evaluate
how changes in the cultural environment couple to the production of metaphor
in discourse systems. By studying violence metaphors relating to politics,
and specifically the presidential elections, we gain insight into what voters
hear as they decide who to vote for. This is a first step towards a deeper
understanding of the cognitive effects of violent talk on political 
decision-making. 

In the United States, and across the free world, politics has always been
adversarial. Although human culture has evolved to settle questions of 
governance at the ballot box, our unconscious and animal minds and bodies participate
as well. Whether we realize it or not, many of our political choices are 
actually unconscious and/or due to circumstance \cite{Westen}. Subliminal 
tendencies towards authoritarianism, aggression, and violence are predictors
of voting behavior \cite{Kalmoe2012}. Because comprehension of metaphor is
known to occur through simulations in the source domain \cite{Gibbs2008} we
can tentatively infer that the fight-or-flight response could be involved in
comprehension of metaphorical violence constructions. The effects of involving
the stress response in politics is not well studied, but one could imagine it
contributes to deepening the divides of American politics.

% Taken out of context it's easy to imagine
% such statements could cause alarm. Language is often underspecified---we need
% to use context or a lifetime of experiences to understand the meaning of 
% a statement. Nowhere is this more true than when we comprehend metaphor. 
% Metaphor ultimately structures abstract concepts, like debates and an election,
% in terms of embodied physical experience. So, when people comprehend the
% examples of figurative violence given above, their fight-or-flight response may
% be triggered, even if briefly or totally unconsciously. Understanding figurative
% violence, especially with regards to politics, is especially important. Such
% figurative violence could be accessing some of our most reflexive cognitive
% systems, which could constrain or force our choice in political reasoning
% and decision-making.

% adversarial. Among English speakers, we often metaphorically structure 
% our politics as physical conflict. In this work we show that there are detectable
% transitions where political events increase the use of figurative violence
% in such political discourse. Part of this work is specifically interested in
% mapping the subtleties of the use of metaphorical violence in the tradition of
% conceptual metaphor theory initiated by the seminal work by \citeA{Lakoff1980}.
% A more fundamental theoretical and methodological contribution is made here
% in the course of analyzing United States' political discourse as a 
% complex dynamical system as broadly suggested by \citeA{Cameron2006}.

% Our cognitive corpus linguistics approach allows us to study metaphor 
% \textit{in the wild}, as opposed to studying literary metaphor. Much of 
% our everyday speech is figurative. The metaphors, and other figurative 
% devices, we use can generally be traced to embodied experiences. There is a
% growing wealth of evidence that our minds access and simulate such 
% embodied experiences when comprehending metaphorical statements 
% \cite{Gibbs2008}. 

% At this point, we can better understand why studying the nature of metaphors
% that arise in politics would be important. Specifically, in the case of
% metaphorical violence, we gain insight into the bitter, embattled feelings
% that accompany elections in the United States. If \textsc{politics is war},
% or more generally \textsc{politics is a fight}, then we deduce that our
% fight-or-flight response would be recruited for comprehension of utterances
% of violent framings of political debate and decision-making, such as voting.
% Such claims are supported by results demonstrating there is a relationship
% between aggressiveness, support for state violence or violence against authority, 
% violence metaphors in political speeches, and voter turnout \cite{Kalmoe2012}.
% Furthermore, \citeA{Westen} reviews many instances where political
% participation decisions are made not through deliberative reasoning, but by
% split-second, unconscious, refelxive reactions.
% By first understanding the dynamics of such language use and their underlying
% cognitive mechanisms, we can work towards
% alternatives that do not require the recruitment of our most primitive 
% cognitive circuitry. 
% For example, adapting an example from \citeA[p. 139]{Lakoff1980}, we might
% advocate for utterances that emerge from the conceptual metaphor
% \textsc{politics is a collaborative work of art}. As we show in this paper,
% the timing of such efforts could be of utmost importance.


% We analyzed a corpus built from scraping the Internet Archive's 
% \href{http://archive.org/tv/details}{TV News Archive} for closed captioning.
% While we could possibly have scraped transcripts directly from cable news
% websites, the Internet Archive also provides a wealth of metadata along with
% closed captioning all from one source, simplifying the process. Also transcripts
% may have been edited, while the Internet Archive's resources were recorded
% at the time of airing. This corpus represents the raw observations of what we
% take as our complex dynamical system: English-language cable news productions
% from the United States. This system is but a manifold of a larger, 
% more complex system,
% the population of the United States making the choice of who to vote for. 
% Cable news serves as
% a nicely-situated proxy in that it simultaneously provides and creates
% a common ground between politicians/political campaigns and the voting public.
% On the one hand, cable news producers must first 
% interpret events in an way meaningful and interesting to themselves \cite{Clark1996}. 
% Then, cable news producers must transmit that information to viewers in a
% way that satisfies a show's sponsors and resonates
% with the viewers. As discussed above, metaphor often provides
% a ready-made conduit that increases the rate of information consumption by
% viewers. For this reason, metaphorical violence describing the 2016 election
% process is ubiquitious across the three networks studied: MSNBC, Fox News, and
% CNN. But, the exact nature of which violent words or phrases are used changes
% for each network, and ostensibly for each program on the network. 

% Novel 
% software, explained further in Section \ref{sec:Methods}, 
% was used to search the corpus for violent words and phrases, which may have been
% used figuratively or not, and possibly related to the election or not.
% These results were then input to a web interface, also newly developed in 
% conjunction with this project, where analysists determined whether or not the
% usage was figurative and related to the election, along with other important
% scientific data, explained further in Section \ref{sec:Methods}. 
% From this coding, we counted the number of times figurative violence was 
% used in each program airing, for each violet word or phrase, termed 
% \textit{facet}, for each day. As an example of the data we collected, the 
% total number of figurative usages across shows of \textit{attack}, \textit{hit}, and
% \textit{beat}, the three most common, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:timeseries}. 
% To better situate these counts, the three debates and the election are drawn
% as dashed vertical lines. In addition to daily counts we also show the 7-day
% moving average of usage. This gives us better intuition of the overall trend
% of usage.

\subsection{Theoretical and Methodological Contribution}
\label{sub:Theoretical-and-Methodological-Contribution}

Discourse can be thought of as a complex dynamical system. Complex in that
there are too many interacting elements to be able to include every one in
an analysis. This is broadly incorporated in our statistical model. 
As for dynamics, we consider a coupling between the cultural environment 
of ongoing presidential debates with the cable news system that ``produces''
utterances of metaphorical violence. With

% Following the bold, but somewhat underdeveloped, proposal of \citeA{Cameron2006},
% we consider the corpus as emergent behavior from a complex dynamical system \cite{Beer2000}.
% There has been accelerating interest in connecting behavioral language data,
% including corpora-from-the-wild. For example, \citeA{Gibbs2012a} explores 
% the coupling between agents and their environments. 
% In this work, Gibbs and Van Orden argue that pragmatic choice is an
% emergent property of a system operating in a state of self-organized 
% criticality. Language evolution is being studied from a dynamical systems perspective, 
% where tendencies for change
% can be understood to emerge from inconsistencies or inefficiencies in a 
% language, or from outside influence \cite{Dale2016}. Also, there has been decades of interest
% in the dynamical systems related to motor skills \cite{Haken1985}, speech 
% production \cite{Kelso1986}, neural dynamics \cite{Chialvo2010}, and more
% \cite{Spivey2007}. 

% The contribution of this paper is that we use the complex dynamical systems
% framing in order to answer an important question: can we meausre the
% impact of cultural
% events, specifically the presidential debates and the election, on the
% frequency of usage of figurative violence on cable news? As discussed before,
% cable news represents a proxy for the cognition of large segments of the
% population. Thus we can gain insight to collective cognitive dynamics among
% the English-speaking voting population of the United States. Specifically,
% assuming there is an effect of these cultural events on figurative violence usage,
% we want to know when the phase transitions occur and on what timescale do they
% occur? There seem to be three equally valid \textit{a priori} hypotheses for
% the timing of phase transitions. First, one might expect usage of figurative
% violence to precede the onset of debates and the election in expectation of the
% metaphorical ``war'' and ``fights'' to follow. Or, the increase in usage
% might lag behind the beginning of debates, and emerge in response to a 
% critical level of political argumentation, debate, etc., has been reached.
% A third, less probable, hypothesis could be that the phase transition occurrs
% exactly on the same date as one of the four cultural events we identified.
% Borrowing further from dynamical systems theory, we show that the phase
% transitions can have a degree of transience. This manifests itself in multiple
% dates having close probabilities of resulting in the best model for segmenting
% the data into phases.
