Human communication systems are complex dynamical systems from which metaphor 
emerges. Or so a series of cognitive linguists have argued over the past decade
or more. What does this mean, exactly? Considered on the whole, the dynamical
system of human communication includes everyone connected on Twitter, with access 
to YouTube, Facebook, and other media and social networks, and then all the
other people that set of people communicates with via other means. 
This dynamical system also contains discrete or prolonged events that change
the context of communication.
This paper demonstrates a set of empirical tools to determine how discourse
can be temporally partitioned in a meaningful way. We also seek to determine 
causation between producers of content,
specifically in the sphere of US cable news. We focus on metaphors that have
as a source domain some violent entailments specifically with regards to the
US elections of 2012 and 2016. By coupling methods from time series analysis 
with semantic network analysis, we can quantify the establishment of new 
metaphors, and whose metaphors are adopted by whom. In this system, the 
``who'' and ``whom'' are cable news networks.
